**Oblivious Transfer (OT)** is a fundamental cryptographic concept that is commonly employed in secure multi-party computation protocols such as **Private Set Intersection (PSI)**. OT enables a sender to transfer one of several possible messages to a receiver without knowing which message was sent or even knowing which message the receiver received.

##  1-out-of-2 OT Random OT Extension

Researchers developed a technique known as "random OT" to improve the efficiency of this process in specific scenarios. Regular OT requires P1 to deliver two pieces of information for each choice (x0 and x1). However, during random OT, P1 is not required to send anything. During the OT, a specific algorithm randomly selects both alternatives (x0 and x1).

The most prevalent kind of OT is 1-out-of-2 OT, in which the sender has two messages (x0, x1) and the receiver picks one of them (xb) without the sender knowing the decision bit b.

 This can be reduced to a modified version of RSA:
 * Alice has two messages: **m<sub>0</sub>** and **m<sub>1</sub>**;
* Generates public parameters **N**, **e** and her private key **d**;
* Sends Bob two random numbers **X<sub>0</sub>** and **X<sub>1</sub>**;
* Bob chooses a message (**Value of b**), generates a secret key **k**, and send to Alice **V**;
* Alice creates two values **P<sub>0</sub>** and **P<sub>1</sub>** with **V** and sends two new messages (m<sub>0</sub><sup>'</sup> and m<sub>1</sub><sup>'</sup>) to Bob;

Example when Bob chooses message 1:

This assures that Bob can only read one of the two messages sent, and Alice does not know which message Bob chose because she does not know if he chose **X0** or **X1** to create the value V.

***This can be generalized to 1-out-of-N OT, where the sender has N messages and the receiver chooses one.***

## Random OT Extension

Researchers developed a technique known as "random OT" to improve the efficiency of this process in specific scenarios. Regular OT requires P1 to deliver two pieces of information for each choice (x0 and x1). However, during random OT, P1 is not required to send anything. During the OT, a specific algorithm randomly selects both alternatives (x0 and x1).

1. P1 doesn't have to give any input in the protocol. It just follows some predefined steps.
2. P2 selects one of the options (**b**) without P1 knowing which one.
3. Instead of P1 sending both options to P2, P1 just generates them using a special function **H** with some random values.
4. P2 still gets the option it chose, but P1 doesn't have to send anything extra.

### Oblivious Pseudo-Random Function (OPRF)

F is a function that accepts a key k from one party (P1) and an input element e from another party (P2), computes and returns Fk(e) to P2. P1 receives no output and learns nothing about e, but P2 knows nothing about k. 
OPRFs can be used for Private Set Intersection (PSI) by first evaluating the OPRF protocol on the set of P2, and then having P1, who knows the secret key k, evaluate the OPRF locally on its own set and send the OPRF output to P2, who computes a plaintext intersection.

## New OT-based Private Set Intersection (PSI) protocol

The authors describe a new OT-based private set intersection (PSI) protocol. Compared to previous conference versions, this protocol's complexity is now independent of bit length Ïƒ for realistic set sizes. The protocol's core is an efficient **oblivious pseudorandom function (OPRF)*** construction that makes use of current OT extension approaches, notably random OT functionality and 1-out-of-N OT.

The protocol operates in three steps:

1. The parties hash their elements into hash tables T1 and T2.
2. The parties mask their elements using the OPRF.
3. The parties compute the plaintext intersection of the masked elements to identify the intersecting elements.
