# [5] A More Efficient Cryptographic Matching Protocol for Use in the Absence of a Continuously Third Party

* protocol where users can verify whether they have matching credentials without revealing their credentials to each other unless there is a match

* consult a trusted third party may not be pratical in a highly distributed situation

* development of cryptographic matchmaking protocols

* Baldwin and Gramlich 1985 protocol
    - third party holds list of encrypted secrets and informs users whenever there is a match
    - to estrablish communication between users, they must first communicate to the third party
    - needs 18 separate messages to establish communication between 2 users which is too large to be practical

## Protocol
* based on the Diffie-Hellman for key exchange
    - A has a secret S<sub>A</sub> and B has S<sub>B</sub>
    - Both share a prime P and S<sub>A</sub> and S<sub>B</sub> are generators of the multiplicative group of Z<sub>P</sub>
    - A chooses a secret number M<sub>A</sub> and B chooses M<sub>B</sub>
    - A &rarr; B: S<sub>A</sub><sup>M<sub>A</sub></sup>
    - B &rarr; A: S<sub>B</sub><sup>M<sub>B</sub></sup>
    - A &rarr; B: S<sub>A</sub><sup>M<sub>B</sub></sup><sup>M<sub>A</sub></sup>
    - B &rarr; A: S<sub>B</sub><sup>M<sub>A</sub></sup><sup>M<sub>B</sub></sup>
* In this example B can falsify a match since he can send back the message from A in step 3
* A or B can verify the match without revealing to the other by adding garbage in the last step

## Use one way functions and signatures

* give A the triple [A, f<sub>A</sub>(S<sub>A</sub>), f<sub>A</sub>] cryptographically signed using private keys and where f is a one way function

* A and B exchange their triples and calculate f<sub>A</sub>(S<sub>B</sub>) and f<sub>B</sub>(S<sub>A</sub>)

* If a user gets another user's triple, he can use it to see who has a matching secret

* Use signatures to keep A and B honest in the steps 1 and 2; also keep A and B honest in the last 2 steps regarding on the difficulty of factoring large integers

### How it works
* all the organizations choose a integer N = (2pq + 1)(2r * 1) whee p,q and r are primes

* $\Phi$(N), the order of the multiplicative group of Z<sub>N</sub>, is 4pqr

* Choose a common generator X of the multiplicative group Z<sub>N</sub>

* Choose u such $u^{p}\equiv 1 mod N$ that can be done by choosing a generator v of the multiplicative group of Z<sub>N</sub> and letting $u = v^{4qr}$ 

* The knowledge of N's factorization is not used again so it can be destroyed

* The organization encrypts all possible secrets by representing each secret as an integer less than p can computing $u^a modulo N$

* Thus any encrypted secret S has the property $S^p \equiv 1 modulo N$. Each organization chooses its own public and private keys

* When A belonging to Org(A) signs up for the system, he receives N, p, S<sub>A</sub> and the public keys of all organizations in the system. He receives M<sub>A</sub> and D<sub>A</sub> and the tuple [A, ORG(A), S<sub>A</sub><sup>M<sub>A</sub></sup>, X<sub>A</sub><sup>M<sub>A</sub></sup>, (S<sub>A</sub><sup>M<sub>A</sub></sup> . X<sub>A</sub><sup>M<sub>A</sub></sup>)<sup>D<sub>A</sub></sup>] where all exponentiations and multiplications are taken modulo N and signed with Organization A public key signature

* The tuple i sused to match user A secrets with other users while A keeps M<sub>A</sub> and D<sub>A</sub> secret

* If A and B wish to mactch secrets using this protocol;

### A cannot find the encrypted secret of B
* A knows S<sub>A</sub><sup>M<sub>A</sub></sup><sup>M<sub>B</sub></sup> and therefore knows S<sub>A</sub><sup>M<sub>B</sub></sup> since he can find M<sub>A</sub><sup>-1</sup> modulo p.

* A, in order to find M<sub>B</sub> he needs to find logarithms over Z<sub>N</sub> with respect to the base S<sub>A</sub> generator of the subgroup of order p of the multiplicative group of Z<sub>N</sub>

#### Heuristic Argument

![alt text](image-1.png)

* A must choose C so that X<sup>M<sub>A</sub>M<sub>B</sub>(C - 1).p</sup> $\equiv$ 1 modulo N
* Can only be achieved by choosing an integer C such (C - 1) % 4qr = 0
    - but if we knew 4qr he would know $\phi(N)$ = 4qr since he knows p.
    - If A knows $\phi(N)$ he would break any RSA cryptosystem

* If $\phi(N)$ is compromissed a user can find out if he has or not a match with another user

* A user can still detect fake matches
    - A user can use a tuple of fake secrets
    - These fake tuples can be used to initiate fake requests for matches

* If a fake tuple is matched is possible to detect the fraud 
* Fake tuples are no protection against users that only want to see who else matches his secret without letting them know

## Conclusion
* Creation of protocol that allows users to verify others credentials in the absence of third parties

* Problems
    - finding logarithms to the base S over Z<sub>B</sub> where $S^\mu \equiv 1 modulo N$
    - Factoring a large integer N when a large factor of $\phi(N)$ is known

* The efficiency of the protocol increases as the size of N decreases
* Obtain good estimates of what size N and p must be
