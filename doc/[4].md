# Scaling Private Set Intersection to Billion-Element Sets

* Private Set Intersection allows 2 parties to find the intersection of their sets without revealing them to each other
    - PSI is a special case of secure multi-part computation

* Applications
    - privacy preserving data mining
    - location-based services
    - genomic computations

* Server-aided model 
    - parties have access to a single untrusted server that makes its computational resources available as a service
    - optimizations over this model make PSI feasible for sets of billion elements communicating over Internet

* Private Equality Testing (PET)

### Multi-part computation
* Limitations
    - are far from optimal for real scenarios with large datasets
    - achieving fairness is not always possible

### Non-collusion
* Implies that two parties, A and B, are not both malicious or compromised by an adversary at the same time
* Ensures that at least one of the parties involved remains honest, which is essential for maintaining the security and integrity of the server-aided protocols
* Either A is malicious or B is malicious, but not both.

* Admissible Subsets
    - Sets of parties that the adversary can potentially compromise in the MPC setting while respecting the non-collusion relations

## Protocols

### 1. Multi-party Protocol (Semi-honest Server)

* Secure against a semi-honest server or collusion of malicious parties
* Parties generate a secret k-bit key for a pseudorandom permutation (PRP) and permute their sets using this key before sending them to the server 
* The server computes the intersection of the permuted sets and returns the result

### 2. Two-party Protocol (Covert or Malicious Server)

* Secure against a covert or malicious server, depending on parameters
* Achieves fairness and hides the size of the intersection from the server
* Parties augment their sets with Î» copies of each element and permute the augmented sets before sending them to the server
* The server computes the intersection, and parties check the correctness of the result to detect any cheating

### 3. Fair Two-party Protocol

* Secure against malicious parties and achieves fairness
* After computing the intersection, the server commits to it and asks parties to reveal their sets and shared key
* The server then verifies the correctness of the intersection and notifies the parties of any cheating

### 4. Intersection Size-Hiding Protocol

* Hides the size of the intersection from the server
* Parties generate shared secret keys for PRPs and send permuted sets to the server 
* The server returns random permutations of the received sets to the parties, who then compute the intersection and remove padding elements to obtain the result

## Implementation

* Languages & Libraries: Implemented in C++ using the Crypto++ library.
* Optimizations: Used efficient data structures, parallelization via multi-threading, and optimizations for scalability.
* PRP: Used AES for faster performance compared to SHA-1.
* Random Permutation: Implemented Fisher-Yates shuffle variant.
* Server Intersection: Implemented using custom hash table-based algorithm and Redis NoSQL database for scalability.

### Detailed

#### 4.1 Client Processing
* PRP Instantiation
    - AES for faster performance compared to SHA-1

* Random Permutation Instantiation
    - Fisher-Yates Shuffle algorithm: shuffles elements in an array by randomly swapping them.

* Communication was identified as a bottleneck
    - Solution: store sets in continuous data structures in memory, reducing the number of send function invocations.

* Label Truncation
    - store tables at the clients to map truncated labels back to their original set elements.

#### 4.2 Server Intersection
* Hash Table-based Intersection
    - folklore set intersection algorithm using hash tables 
    - involves hashing elements from one set into a hash table and then looking up elements from the second set in this table to determine their intersection status


#### 4.3 Redis-based Implementation (NOSQL)

* choosen due to its efficiency with large datasets

* enhance insertion performanceusing Redis pipelining, which batches commands and sends them in a single step, reducing round-trip delays.
